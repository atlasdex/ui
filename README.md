## What is ATLAS?
ATLAS is a cross-chain DEX (decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, which gives traders the best pricing for their trades by using an advanced trade routing algorithm) that runs on the Solana network. ATLAS was created to offer traders a sole user-friendly UI that provides aggregated liquidity. The primary purpose of ATLAS is to become a crypto traderâ€™s number one platform for the implementation of trades using any token that is supported under DEX.
